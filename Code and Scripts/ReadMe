The MATLAB folder contains the following scripts:

angle.m: To find the orientations for the special grain boundaries
specgrain.m: Plots related to the special grain boundaries
Result.m: Some experimentation with the output (Not required for the results presented)
PlotsAll.m: All other remaining plots

The Python folder contains various folders with similar codes:
To run the simulation, one must run RunLammps.py followed by ReadDump.py (for the experimentation done in Result.m (Not required for the results presented)
